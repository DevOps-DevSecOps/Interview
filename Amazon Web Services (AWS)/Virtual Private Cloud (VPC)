AWS reserves 5 IP address in each subnet CIDR block. Cannot be assigned to an instance.
The first 4 addresses are reserved for infrastructure services
The last 1 address is the broadcast
EG: In a Subnet with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, the following 5 ip addresses are reserved
10.0.0.0   -> Network Address.
10.0.0.1   -> Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
10.0.0.2   -> DNS Server.
10.0.0.3   -> Reserved by AWS for future use.
10.0.0.255 -> Broadcast Address.
