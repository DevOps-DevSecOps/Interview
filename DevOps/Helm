(1) What and Why we need Helm Charts ?
Its helps in managing Kubernetes applications - its help us to define install, upgrade, delete.
Charts are very easy to create, version, share, publish. 

(2) What is difference between V2 and V3 ?
V3:-
The Cluster have RABC objects (Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding, ClusterRoleBinding) are enabled.
Tiller component is removed.
Helm Client will maintain all informations like Versioning, Releases.
Installation also very easy (Helm Client).
It consider both what ever the changes that made in Helm Charts and using Kubectl CLI.
Helm Chart 'RELEASE_NAME' will be reusable in different Namespaces with in a Cluster, it work.
Where dependencies are added under the dependencies section in 'Chart.yaml'.
Helm Chart 'RELEASE_NAME' is mandatory (OR) Can use "--generate-name".
V2:-
The Cluster doesn't RABC objects (Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding, ClusterRoleBinding) are not enabled.
Tiller component is available. 
Tiller will maintain all informations like Versioning, Releases.
Installation also very hard (Helm Client, Tiller Server).
What ever the changes was already there done by using Kubectl CLI will be ignore. Its only take the changes which are only in the Helm Chart. 
In 'default' Namespace have installed Helm Chart 'RELEASE_NAME' and it can't use same Helm Chart 'RELEASE_NAME' in different Namespace, it won't work.
Where dependencies are added under the dependencies section in 'requirements.yaml'.
If ignoring a Helm Chart 'RELEASE_NAME' will took a random 'RELEASE_NAME'.
