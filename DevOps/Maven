(1) What is the clean command in Maven ?

(2) How to inter-link parent pom.xml with child pom.xml ?
● Multi-Module 
A multi-module project is built from an aggregator POM that manages a group of submodules. The aggregator is located in the project root directory and must have packaging of type POM. The submodules are regular Maven projects and they can be built separately or through the aggregator POM.
● Dependency-Management 
It is a core feature of Maven. Managing dependencies for multi-module projects and applications that consist of hundreds of modules.

(3) What is Maven, the benefit of integrating Maven with Jenkins ?

(4) What is Maven Build Lifecycle ?
Three Types
● default 
default lifecycle handles your project deployment.
● clean 
clean lifecycle handles project cleaning. Three phases like pre-clean, clean, post-clean.
● site 
site lifecycle handles the creation of your project's site documentation. Four phases like pre-site, site, post-site, site-deploy. It will generate project report include like License, Summary, Dependencies, CI Report, HTML Document.

(5) What are Maven Goals ?
These lifecycle phases are executed sequentially to complete the default lifecycle. The default lifecycle is used, Maven will first validate the project, then will try to compile the sources, run those against the tests, package the binaries (e.g. jar), run integration tests against that package, verify the integration tests, install the verified package to the local repository, then deploy the installed package to a remote repository.
The phases of default lifecycle are 7 in below
validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
compile - compile the source code of the project.
test - test the compiled source code using suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed.
package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met.
install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally.
deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

(6) What is .m2 folder in Maven ?

(7) What are the settings you need to do in pom.xml for running mvn deploy ?

(8) .m2 folder is a local repository for maven, now I don’t want to use .m2 folder as local repository I want to use some other folder as local repository ?
    How to set custom repository instead using .m2 local repository ?
Yes, can do it in 2 ways
Command: mvn clean install -Dmaven.repo.local=PATH_with_DIRECTORY_NAME 
In ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml (/home/ubuntu/.m2/settings.xml) can change the path
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <localRepository>${user.home}/.m2/repository</localRepository>
    <interactiveMode>true</interactiveMode>
    <offline>false</offline>
    ...
</settings>
localRepository: This value is the path of this build system’s local repository. The default value is ${user.home}/.m2/repository. This element is especially useful for a main build server allowing all logged-in users to build from a common local repository.

(9) In which tag we will mention artifact outputs like jar, war, OR some any other in pom.xml ?
    What is the default value of Packaging tag ? What other values for other artifact types ?
In pom.xml, Have to mention the war packaging tag like <packaging>war</packaging> and for jar packaging tag is not necessary to mention because it’s a default as jar. 
# Example - JAR
<groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>
<artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
<packaging>jar</packaging>
# Example - WAR
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
<version>2.3.2</version>
<packaging>war</packaging>

(10) What command to skip the test cases in Maven ?
mvn install -DskipTests

(11) What is the role of setting.xml in Maven ?

(12) Can we build a project without pom.xml in Maven ?

(13) What are GAV ?
G - groupId, A - artifactId, V - version
# Example
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
<version>3.3.0</version>

(14) What are the things need to set if want download dependency from private repository ?
All the dependencies plugin will downloaded from Public Central Repository (repo.maven.apache.org) to Local Repository (.m2) that very 1st time while executing a maven command.
The dependencies plugin will downloaded from Public Central Repository (repo.maven.apache.org) that stores in to Local Repository (.m2) folder.
