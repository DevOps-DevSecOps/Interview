What is PagerDuty ?
PagerDuty is an incident management platform that provides reliable notifications, automatic escalations, on-call scheduling, and other functionality to help teams detect and fix infrastructure problems quickly.

What notification methods do you support ?
Incident notifications are automatically sent using any preferred combination of phone calls, SMS, push notifications and emails. 
You can customize these notification methods, so that incidents dynamically select the right notification behavior depending on their severity, time of day, or during defined support hours.

What if the on-call engineer doesn’t respond ?
PagerDuty allows you to specify escalation rules.
When an incident is triggered, PagerDuty will first try to contact the level-one on-call responder for the incident.
If that person doesn’t answer within the user-specified escalation timeout, PagerDuty will automatically escalate to the level-two responder, and so on.
You can notify up to 5 users/schedules in a single escalation rule, and we support up to 20 escalation rules for each escalation policy.
